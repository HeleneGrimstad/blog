        Edvard Munch was one of Modernism's most significant artists. His tenacious experimentation within painting, graphic art, drawing, sculpture, photo and film has given him a unique position in Norwegian as well as international art history.
Edvard munch was one of the most significant artists of his time. His paintings reflect a difficult upbringing when tuberculosis hit
the Norwegian coastline and the artist lost his mother at only four years old and his older sister at 14 years old. Not long after Munch also lost his father and brother. After his losses, Munch communicated emotions through his paintings.
His artworks are filled with anxiety, death, love and jealousy that he expresses through brutal brush strokes and colours.

        The artist was inspired by new methods and experimented with film and photography, which we can enjoy today. Edvard Munch
is today known for painting his feelings and allowing his emotions to be expressed in his art. The painting he is most known for, The scream, is a great example of
Despair. The artist's emotional expression through colours and brushstrokes. The artwork is filled with colours and illustrates an individual in total hysteria looking over the city of Oslo. The person is himself, getting an anxiety attack when he was going for a walk with his friends.
